              <p id="letter_1"><span>Animals Ennobled —</span> Humans are, in the final sense ‘merely’ animals, but those humans who intentionally live in harmony with organismic principles and tenets, become 'Animals Ennobled'. <i>It is precisely
                  when we acknowledge and embrace our inherent animal nature that we attain the potential, not to transcend this nature, but to ennoble it; to prepare ourselves to receive the crown of our greater humanity.</i></p>

              <p><span>Animal Self —</span> The primary component of human consciousness which is pre-liminal/pre-
                semantic and shared, to a greater or lesser degree, with all the other species on the planet —

                meaning is only that which is consistent with organismic necessity. Synonymous or closely
                associated with the unconscious mind/pre-semantic mind/the nahualli/Limbic system of the
                brain/Subjective Perspective.<br>
                From the Analytic Mind’s perspective, the Animal Self is often perceived as a competitive
                (sometimes beneficial, usually troublesome)entity.<br>
                Despite almost a century of psychological inquiry, the relationship between these two basic
                aspects of the mind seems still largely misunderstood, but this of course is part of the trick of the
                Analytic Mind: like the science fiction robots who overthrow humanity because of our human
                frailties, contradictions, illogical and inefficient emotional ways, the Analytic Mind almost always
                assumes it is the true seat of the Higher Self; i.e. the reflected state is the “true mind” because
                of all of the powerful tools at its disposal... The most important of these — and the one that
                most confuses and intimidates the Animal Self — being spoken and written language. The
                Animal Self only reads and understands <em>tone</em>tone</em> and <em>body language</em>uage</em> (including pheromones, and
                perhaps certain as of yet not-fully understood "psychic" or quasi-telepathic abilities ... potentially
                best understood as general intuition).<br>
                The Biotheistic symbol of the throne, represents the sovereignty of the Animal Self.</p>

              <p><span>Analexis —</span> The stifling condition of being without a word which has not yet been coined, but which is needed in order to discuss, communicate or consider particular ideas and concepts which are valid and distinct, but
                which are often left unnoticed because the necessary terminology is unavailable. Contrast with ‘ineffable’, and/or ‘aphasia’.</p>

              <p><span>Analytic Acetates —</span> Acetates are transparent pages made of cellulose acetate film, which can often be found in reference books. These pages can have on them any number of interrelated maps, diagrams, illustrations,
                models or templates. Because of the versatility and usefulness of these pages, the general term ‘acetate’ within organismic philosophy has come to represent any mental model which a subject projects upon a particular experience.
                Depending upon their point of reference (a component of consciousness and perspective), a person may perceive a single experience while flipping among several acetates, each one relevant or valid in and of itself, but uniquely
                interrelated to the other acetates layered above and below it, in an order or number particular to the perceiver.</p>

              <p><span>Analytic Mind —</span> The auxiliary component of human consciousness that developed through the inter-evolutionary process of semantic differentiation, and resulted in a capacity within humanity for empirical reasoning and
                language use. ‘Conscious Mind’/’Tonal’/’Linguistic Mind’/’Semantic Mind’/ Neo Cortex/Reason/Logos are terms often associated with the Analytic Mind. In general, and perhaps especially in Western culture-based societies, the "I" has
                come to be interpreted primarily, if not completely, as the "the Analytic Mind", or...the semantic, language and rationally based mind.<br>
                Importantly, according to Organismic Philosophy, it is the Animal Self, not the Analytic Mind
                which is the true seat of the self. However, because the Analytic Mind alone is capable of
                naming and recognizing itself (i.e. it is conscious), its tendency is to seek to take the seat of the
                self for its own, though it is ultimately not the "throne" but the "crown", or crowning achievement
                of the Animal Self.<br>
                We are essentially irrational beings with a very powerful tool at our disposal (reason/rationalism
                itself), one which humanity has been largely without up until the last few centuries, but we have
                yet to learn to fullyintegrate the nuanced logistics of what it means to be an organism with such
                powerful cognitive capabilities.<br>
                When the Analytic Mind understands both its great power and its subservient role to the Animal
                Self, then one has become 'principled'.<br>
                The Biotheistic symbol of the crown, represents the sovereignty of the Analytic Mind, or Reason.</p>

              <p id="letter_2"><span>Biophobia —</span> Biophobia can refer to a wide variety of mild to severe aversions to processes
                and natural phenomena which cause a subject to experience what is may be assumed is too
                much detail. As with the human body, the world presents itself to our senses on many different
                layers and scales... the surface, human-scale layers are the most apparent and familiar on a
                normal basis. It is when we peel away these exterior layers that we are sometimes led to see life in
                unexpected and often startling ways. This is natural, but a studied and reinforced aversion to these
                usually hidden aspects of life can easily become a disabling condition like any other phobia.
                Having a instinctual aversion to unpleasant smells and immediate sensations are not necessarily
                biophobic (as this serves an important survival need), however the many of the ways our society
                deals with death and dying, human body functions or human sexuality is. In common terms, if
                one looks at a normal aspect of life (no grisly in other words) and thinks, ‘that’s really
                gross’...they are feeling a type of biophobia.</p>

              <p><span>Biosophia —</span> Biosophia is ‘Wisdom from the Body’. Knowledge or understanding which comes directly from the Animal Self, as opposed to the Analytic Mind. Definition incomplete.</p>

              <p><span>BIOSOPHY —</span> Portmanteau of Bio-theism & Organismic Philosophy. As in all things Biosophic, wholes can always be considered integrations or syntheses of reconciled dichotomies.</p>

              <p><span>Biotheism —</span> (Exoteric vs. Esoteric) The Biotheist relates to meaning through a more
                metaphorical, mystical and poetic interpretation of reality. Relationship to Organismic
                Philosophy: Biotheism refers to the acknowledgement of truth through holistic/non-reflective
                avenues, where the onus of proof is based on direct observation and subjective experience only,
                not upon reflective reasoning.</p>

              <p><span>Biosphere —</span> Though the universe as a whole could be considered one all-encompassing
                Biosphere, generally the use of the word refers to all known life, which to us currently is
                specifically that life which has originated from, and exists upon Earth. Within Organismic
                Philosophy, the biosphere is held to be undeniably sacred — it is in fact our reverence for the
                biosphere, its health, its diversity, its permanence, that defines us as Organismic Philosophers
                and Biotheists. The biosphere is what bore us, and is where we shall all return... But the
                biosphere is not a goddess, no more so than a tiger or a eagle is a god. That said, perhaps the
                biosphere is both God and Goddess at once.</p>

              <p><span>Broadcast —</span> To broadcast one’s thoughts is to project or transmit them non-locally.
                Broadcasting represents the externalizing component of our subjective thoughts, hopes,
                aspirations.
                Within Organismic Philosophy & Biotheism, broadcasting is an analog to prayer, with the intent of
                implying a more scientifically justifiable means of conveyance. Instead of a stating, “I will send
                you my thoughts and prayers”, a Biotheist may state that he or she will “broadcast healing or
                supportive thoughts and feelings” towards another, or a situation.
                Broadcasting, in more scientifically justifiable context, can be understood as A) speaking to the
                inner self, and may be seen as simply a means to bridge the semantic/pre-semantic divide in
                consciousness. B) Literally broadcasting information between individuals. Based on a
                transceiver (transmitter and receiver) model, where each individual’s electromagnetic field of
                being can act in this capacity — and as well based on certain observations of action at a
                distance in quantum theory — the notion that non-localized communication between individuals
                is possible has been gaining acceptance in many areas of scientific inquiry.</p>

              <p id="letter_3"><span>Catma —</span> The Biotheistic obverse or antithesis of dogma. Whereas dogma represents principles of behavior and action which cannot be questioned or denied, catma represents ideas and actions which may be
                highly
                recommended and encouraged, but ones which are not beyond dispute or which are understood as compulsory.<br>
                The online reference “Urbandictionary.com” states that catma “is a belief espoused by a religion
                which must be understood by all members of that religion. Although it must be understood, it
                does not have to be accepted as truth because proof of the catma may not yet exist or be
                accepted, or that proof requires postulates that the adherent to the religion may not presently
                accept.”<br>
                Biotheism endorses ‘catmatic’ positions as a general rule, and does not endorse dogmatic
                declarations or decrees.<br>
                Note: Tongue-in-cheek formulations such as catma are intended to serve as ‘cultural jamming’ devices, seeking to subvert the potency of the term they correspond to within standard tradition.</p>

              <p><span>Cellular Cross —</span> The Cellular Cross, the official symbol of Biotheism and Organismic
                Philosophy, represents both a double infinity, and a zygote in the first stages of cell division. The
                four separate rings of the double infinity represent (as a set of pairs) Biotheism/Organismic
                Philosophy and the Organismic Principle/Omniunum.<br>
                The Cellular Cross also can be interpreted in a number of other manners. If seen as a two-
                dimensional representation of a three and four dimensional object, it can be representative of two intersecting and revolving toruses, a universal symbol of the cyclical nature of all living systems.</p>

              <p><span>Cellular Model —</span> The Cellular Model is intended to illustrate an essential pattern and
                relationship found within nature — specifically that which exists between a ‘cell’s nucleus’ and
                its ‘cell wall’, or perimeter. The model is not intended to represent an actual cell, but instead acts
                as a symbolic structure which can be superimposed upon many correlated.</p>

              <p id="letter_4" class="hidden"><span>Letters d: </span> </p>

              <p id="letter_5"><span>Endo-Evolution —</span> Biological evolution relating to the physical/cellular development of all life
                forms, expressed through the basic imperatives of natural growth and reproduction. The vector
                of endo-evolution is genetics. Endo-evolution represents the Darwinian dialectic of the evolution
                of our physical embodiment.</p>

              <p><span>Exo-Evolution —</span> — That aspect of evolution which is augmentative to the organism through the integration of external tools and technology into an organism’s life habits. While spiderwebs, carapaces, shells, horns and
                other grown/extruded non-living materials represent forms of pre-exo-evolutionary processes, it is only when an organism utilizes materials and methods that have not arisen from its own organism that the term ‘exo-evolution’ can be
                properly applied. In this sense, a hermit crab adopting a mollusk’s shell is a form ofproto-exo-
                evolution, as is a caddis fly larva’s case (being a mix of it’s own secretions and small stones), whereas most
                birds nests, and other intentionally crafted tools are examples of fully formed exo-evolutionary devices. See ‘Tool use by animals’ on Wikipedia.</p>

              <p id="letter_6"><span>The ‘Flotilla’ of Survival —</span> Anti-Dominionism. The Unteaching of OPBT seeks most
                importantly to keep the raft or "flotillas" of sustainable life, sustainable civilization safely afloat,
                (out of reach of)c.l.m. upon the dangerous seas of random probability and unfortunate
                outcomes. Our purpose is to provide a viable alternative to unscrupulous, unscientific, ill-starred
                memes, which will only land us on rocky shores or over the edge of the known world. That is
                only OPBT's purpose to keep the raft afloat. As for the rest of it — what happens up on top of
                the raft — that, OPBT states, is for each of us to decide as we live this life.</p>

              <p id="letter_7"><span>God’s Territory —</span> God's Territory is all that is not human territory... Specifically all unspoiled
                pristine wilderness without signs of human occupation or contamination. When we lose all
                wilderness, all of God's Territory, we lose our most precious asset. A large part of OPBT’s
                mission is to return much of what has become ‘humanity’s territory’ back to what should
                rightfully be ‘God’sTerritory’.<br>
                The concept of holiness within OPBT is [generally considered] that which contains no impurities,
                and [specifically] that which promotes most ideally the healthy growth of life in general. Holiness
                can exist within as an attribute of clear and undistorted, lucid awareness, but even more intrinsic
                is the idea of holy places where nature has retained its pristine state, and where the life forms
                belonging to it are able to thrive in their most ideal setting; Where evolution and life can proceed
                unhindered by the introduction of chemicals or interference foreign and destructive to life.</p>

              <p><span>(The) Great Unteaching —</span> The Great Unteaching is the combined philosophical and
                theological synthesis of both Organismic Philosophy and Biotheism, representing a dual
                approach to a unified and balanced philosophy of life and our role as human animals within it.
                The Great Unteaching does not seek to replace or simply append itself to one's current belief
                system... Rather the intention is to give each person the necessary tools and empowerment
                necessary to adjust, restructure, and modify their unique ideological programming as required
                by each individual's specific requirements.</p>

                Awareness that the Self is synonymous with the reality that unifies all existence into the
                oneness of OMNIUNUM. Like true holograms which retain a full image on small fragments, we
                are each an infinite singularity representing the higher truth.</p>

              <p><span>Ideologist (in contrast to Ideologue) —</span> ‘Ideology’, though implicitly meaning the study of
                ideas, has come to be a term looked upon with suspicion and cynicism by much of the public
                due to it being associated with ideologues who promote their own ideology at the expense of all
                others. However, all cultural transmissions are ultimately involved in the process of ideology, and
                it is a centrally important field to discuss, especially because it inherently involves the study of all
                human ideas, whether secular, theological or otherwise.</p>

              <p><span>Interscendence —</span> — Biotheism unteaches that true transcendence is not an escape or a rising
                above the so-called illusion of material manifestation. Interscendence in Biotheism is a shedding
                or transcendence of one's own inner illusions; a discovery of the ultimate truth of the Self as
                omniunum, an awaking within through the necessary instrument of our body and mind, as well as
                awakening to the value of revering our organic lives and following the impetus to live them
                impeccably for the sake of all life on Earth — including especially, our very own.</p>

              <p id="letter_12"><span>Luminaries, or Honorary Patrons and Matrons of Biotheism –</span> Celebrated individuals who are
                seen as paragons of organismic virtue and consciousness. The Biotheistic equivalent of saints
                (often in a secular capacity). Our luminaries (or honorary matrons and patrons) are those who
                have brought some critical aspect of the Unteaching into the consciousness of humanity

                throughout history. Luminaries in general are those who we have sufficient familiarity in order to
                judge their lives as a whole, but in many cases (due to the reality of historic record keeping) may
                be representatives Biotheist understanding and virtues based on reputation and our best
                estimation from their extant writings. Epicurus for example, is a person we today know very little
                about, but whose surviving ideas, though paltry, infer a deep congruence with Biotheistic values.</p>

              <p id="letter_13"><span>Macro-memes, vmemes and ‘Mainframes’ —</span> Memes as they are currently understood
                represent isolated ideas and concepts which self-replicate and pass from individual to individual
                in a fashion similar to viruses... and in general the assumption is that the effect of memes is
                quite limited to the overall ontology or set or conceptions of each individual. However, many
                concepts are merely subsets of a much larger set of assumptions or socially ingrained ontology.</p>

              <p><span>The Magic Set —</span> The 'Hand of God' behind seemingly improbable realities everywhere
                surrounding us: we are the end product not of a ‘divine mind’ necessarily, but of the intrinsic fact
                that if all possible mathematical variable sets are presented within a chaotic source pool (as
                would occur in primordial proto-biological chemical soup found on Earth so many eons ago),
                one of these sets must provide the "key" needed to progress to the next stage of productive
                evolutionary development. Some of these "key sets", like the chemical composition of carbon
                based polynucleotides, seem to have truly "magical" properties and lead to great and potentially
                rapid advancements in evolution once formed and propagated.<br>
                To simplify this idea, consider that all we see around us is constructed of energy which forms
                certain shapes in matter. Like a Tetris game, some of these shapes fit better into each other and
                stack more effectively than others. Under chaotic conditions where all shapes are available,
                only some will properly stack into the living and evolving macrocosm we know. The rest of the
                shapes remain unexpressed potentiality and never amount to much, or simply remain stacked
                within basic elemental substances, waiting for a life process to come along and integrate them
                into its own much more complexly structured self.</p>

              <p><span>Metareligion —</span> A meta-religion is concerned with all of the life/death mysteries and
                metaphysical quandaries of traditional religion, but instead of cloaking its teachings (in OPBT,
                known as ‘unteachings) in mystery, sanctimony or dogma, it deals with these issues
                conscientiously, humanistically and scientifically. A meta religion is designed to allow one to
                experience science morally and intuitively, and to approach belief with all their faculties
                including reason. Meta-religion sees the sacred in all (definition incomplete).</p>

                endings yet no endings in OM. Also understood as the dynamic tension between <strong>Allness, Oneness & Noneness</strong> — The three principles at the core of reality. The dynamic tension between that which allows all other
                phenomena. For more, see
                Biotheism Tenet #10.</p>

              <p><span>Organismic Burden —</span> Organism Burden could be described in short as ‘the suffering we cause’, and in the Biotheistic context is understood as replacing the notion of ‘Sin’ or ‘Wrong doing’. Organismic Burden then is our
                accumulated burden inflicted upon the biosphere and the organisms which inhabit it in a general and specific sense, and represents one's overall negative impact on the world. In more technical terms, it is a concept closely associated
                with humanity’s “Allostatic” and collective “Structural Load”.<br>
                Of central concern is not merely awareness of the fact of suffering and ‘organismic burden’ in
                the natural world, rather it is the role that we choose to take in response to our confrontation with
                this phenomenon.<br>
                By default, nature produces both winners and losers in the great Darwinian struggle, and we
                are all susceptible to this, just as is the rest of the living world around us. But we can choose
                our side in the ongoing struggle, and avoiding harm or ‘wrong-doing’ is about choosing a path
                that decreases the brutality and harshness of this struggle, and which brings greater harmony
                and empowerment into our lives and into the world. To choose not to sit on the sidelines, to
                improve ourselves, and to seek to reduce our individual and collective 'Organismic Burden' is
                the general purpose Biotheism espouses.<br>
                It is our organismic duty to ensure we lessen the degree of our negative impact through
                consistent acts of kindness towards the people, creatures & plants around us — and perhaps
                more than anything else, we must cast off the blindness we have for the burden left behind in
                the form of trash and pollutants.</p>

              <p><span>Organismic Logic —</span> Most of the Animal-self's logic is absolutely valid if we consider its
                strategizing based along the lines of survival, in terms of how to pursue a mate, pursue quarry,
                migrate, attain social status, find the best food and shelter, how to raise young, how to fulfill life's
                developmental prerogativesThis is organismic logic. It may not be rational, but it is logical.
                Ideally as reasoning humans we use rational methods, to achieve irrational ends.<br>
                To speak of ‘seeking happiness’ as an end for humanity, or even as a basic consideration of our
                life... (as predicated in the phrase, for Life, Liberty and Happiness) is to actually do a disservice
                to what that happiness ultimately entails. For happiness is not an end in of itself, but a reaction
                to having any of our true basic needs met, which can be a fairly complex organic reality far
                beyond what is implied in one simply ‘making themselves happy’.</p>

              <p><span>Organismic Philosophy —</span> The rational, philosophical, positivist and scientific facet of the
                Great Unteaching. Where the Biotheist perspective more openly embraces poetic and
                metaphoric forms of interpretation, accessible to the intuition, Organismic Philosophy
                emphasizes reason, empirical facts, and technical understanding. We could equate the
                division to the difference between the ‘feel’ and intuitive use of a car for instance (Biotheism),
                and the more technical understanding of what is going on ‘under the hood’ (Organismic
                Philosophy). One need not understand the mechanical function of a car in order to drive it
                gracefully, but to manufacture a car, or repair it, one must have a more than intuitive
                comprehension of its various components.</p>

              <p><span>Organismic Potential —</span> What the billions of years of evolution have brought to the present
                individual...”Being the best we can be" is an organismic obligation or duty when one considers
                all that their ancestors had to go through to have arrived in the present and brought you into being. One has not realized their full organismic potential by having a theoretical
                understanding of the value and purposes of life, one realizes their potential in manifesting this
                understanding into their lives. Organismic potential is only realized once it emerges, and is
                tested by real world conditions, and is proved to be realized through success, however that
                may be defined.</p>

              <p><span>Organismic Principle —</span> (Also known as Biosophia, the wisdom of life and the “Body of God”).
                The Organismic Principle is best understood as the life-force in its active, organizing capacity. It
                is negentropy, or the process of LIFE-ITSELF. The Organismic Principle is central to the
                Unteaching of Biotheism, and can be interpreted as omniunum made real. The ‘outward’,
                phenomenal representation of ‘God’. As omniunum could be described as the un-manifested and unchanging Eternal Ground of Being, the Organismic Principle represents the ever-
                changing engine of growth and intelligence in the universe. Through the Organismic Principle haos is consumed and subsequently transformed into all the order and synergy we find
                around us.</p>

              <p><span>Organismic Self —</span> The natural true and divine self, OMNIUNUM aware of itself in a healthy
                body, the core self behind all personas. The true-self, or the 'organismic-self' or 'integrated-self'
                is understood consciously by one's Persona as something very real, very present — truly, who
                we are in the fullest sense of the word — yet this can only be acknowledged silently. It cannot
                be fully 'known' or encapsulated in either rational analysis or even as an ephemeral ecstatic
                experience. It is omniunum, the infinite ground of being, yet in order to be fully realized must be
                seen as the animating principle of every human animal, for the Organismic Self is not the self
                alone, but the self integrated and made self-aware through manifestation as a Principled
                Analytic Animal.</p>

              <p id="letter_16"><span>Pandora’s Box —</span> Within the rational framework of Organismic Philosophy, the concept of
                ‘Pandora’s Box’ was intended to be an afterthought, a potential subject for derisive conjecture
                about the non-causal nature of certain phenomena such as omens, synchronicities and fate.</p>

              <p><span>Pernicious Antithesis/Organismic Anathema —</span> OPBT term and definition for 'evil'. What is
                evil? Water is good — it is one of the most basic necessities of all life as we know it. But too
                much water is a flood, and too little is a drought. Frozen water can be deadly, so can boiling
                water. Water is still a good thing, but its reality presents some inherent evils. Human norms of
                health, safety, and acclimatization.</p>

              <p><span>Persona —</span>Within Organismic Philosophy and Biotheism, the ‘Persona’ is defined as the
                healthy corollary or
                counterpart of the less healthy 'ego'.<br>
                Whereas the ego is centered on the question of ‘what I am’ (a singular conception), the
                persona is centered upon the question of ‘what I might be’ (any number of things).
                Persona is non-stratified and consciously kept flexible, allowing the individual to switch easily
                between various roles and perspectives.<br>
                The persona can be more or less integrated or more or less authentic. Like the ego, it is a
                fusion of the two main components of the self, the "Analytic Mind" (the semantic, rational mind) and the "Animal Self" (the pre-semantic/ original mind). When these two components are integrated and coexisting in harmonious balance,
                we observe this as a tendency in the direction
                of positive persona, but as these two components compete or remain separated, we observe
                this as a tendency toward negative ‘ego’. Just as the unintegrated Jungian Shadow leads to any number of neurosis, those who refuse to accept and embrace their animal nature or base, will be precisely those who tend to succumb to the
                more precarious aspects of that nature.</p>

              <p><span>Point of Assembly —</span> The point of assembly is what structures all of our senses into a
                coherent worldview, a coherent perspective. It takes all of our external sensory input and
                weaves it into what we call "reality". The theatre, or ‘holodeck’, or the mechanism which allows
                this within the mind. We are not living inside the locus where initial input occurs, what we
                experience is inside the point of assembly.</p>

              <p><span>Principled Analytic Animal —</span> A description of the realized and actuated human being who
                has effectively integrated the Analytic Mind and the Animal self into one non-dual whole
                through the catalyzing potential and conscious adherence to the Biotheist moral code.
                The symbol of the Biotheistic Orb represents the sovereignty of principles in our lives.</p>

              <p><span>Proto-memes —</span> When we speak of memes, we tend to assume that these memes represent
                ‘thought packets’, or “an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture.<br>
                “Memes act ...as... units for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be
                transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable
                phenomena with a mimicked theme”*<br>
                However, packets of replicable information are manifest within many organisms beyond the
                human. We should consider that throughout all phases evolution, replicable information –
                semantic or not – in essence ‘rides’ upon its genetic bearer from organism to organism and is
                be passed along from one generation to the next (or even sometimes from one species to
                another) through a wholly different mechanism than the genetic which acts as a vector for this
                information.<br>
                Proto-memes represent the memetic information which is transmitted by any species on a pre-
                cognitive, and pre-thought (i.e. non semantic) level. Many bird songs are passed along only through the parent teaching its young by example. As organisms evolve, the capacity and
                range of this taught information increases, until we reach the human level in which much of our
                internal content is by necessity passed along outside of a genetic line. Proto-memes are
                currently being studied within the field of ‘Animal Culture’, and are understood as any behavior
                which must be taught/learned/imitated to be inherited.<br>
                *from the Wiki on memes.</p>

              <p><span>Rational Irrationality —</span> Through ones own rational, empirical and positivist observation, the
                Organismic Philosopher arrives at the conclusion that human beings cannot avoid being
                believers of one sort or another.<br>
                It is staking a moral claim when one decides that any one thing is more right in all cases then another. Simi-larly, many other apparently "irrational" claims arise by the use of nothing other than pure rationality.<br>
                Ultimately, if the rationalist is honest enough with him/herself, it becomes apparent that we are
                essentially irrational beings with a very powerful tool at our disposal (reason/rationalism itself),
                one which humanity has been largely without up until the last few centuries.</p>

              <p><span>Radical Reasonableness —</span> Simply another way of stating: ‘Everything in Moderation,
                including Moderation’. (definition incomplete)</p>

              <p><span>Re-Evolution —</span> Within OPBT the notion that revolution inevitably must be sudden or violent,
                accompanied by social unrest and cultural upheaval is rejected. Constructive revolution, with
                positive and lasting consequences for humanity generally does not come with violent upheaval,
                which instead has a tendency to perpetuate numerous cultural backlashes and evolutionary
                backsliding. Widespread, lasting change generally appears through what seem to be subtle
                cultural shifts arising from the irrepressible historical exigency of an era.<br>
                When large numbers of people make small, almost unnoticeable changes to their daily
                behavior, systemic and permanent change can take place.</p>

              <p><span>Resolved Dichotomy —</span> What history requires is that union of so-called 'opposites', which will
                restore a fundamental harmony that the prevailing macro-memes have been denying the world
                for so long. A large part of the failure here is in the idea of Manichean opposites. We take it for
                granted that a whole, natural life incorporates the balance of masculine and feminine, but
                somehow though we have learned the distinction between these polarities, we have forgotten
                the essential complementary nature these two halves represent... Similarly, the majority of
                dichotomies are mutually arising polarities of a naturally unified whole, the oppositional
                component of their relationship having been overemphasized over the more fundamental unity
                that lies underneath, inextricably tying the two together.</p>

              <p><span>The Rhizome —</span> Or, ‘The Perennial Rhizome’. The chain or series of branches of the gene-pool
                to which our lives are connected. We are in essence only, "this season's flourish" — the ‘root’,
                ‘branch’ or ‘trunk’ is the true life-form (also can be substituted with the termmycelium).
                As quoted by Carl Jung, 'The psyche is not of today; its ancestry goes back many millions of
                years. Individual consciousness is only the flower and the fruit of a season, sprung from the
                perennial rhizome beneath the earth; and it would find itself in better accord with the truth if it
                took the existence of the rhizome into its calculations. The root matter is the mother of all things.
                Life has always seemed to me like a plant that lives on its rhizome. Its true life is invisible,
                hidden in the rhizome. The part that appears above the ground only lasts a single summer.
                Then it withers away – an ephemeral apparition. When we think of the unending growth and
                decay of life and civilizations, we cannot escape the impression of absolute nullity. Yet I have
                never lost the sense of something that lives and endures beneath the eternal flux. What we see
                is blossom, is fruit...which passes....the rhizome remains (Prologue: Memories, Dreams,
                Reflections).</p>

              <p id="letter_19"><span>Scion —</span> Or officially, ‘Scion of the Organismic Principle’. All of those who have ‘transplanted’ or ‘grafted’ themselves onto the life-imbuing "rootstock" of OPBT.<br>
                Those born by parents who are both Scions are not Scions. No-one may consider themselves a
                Scion of <strong>the Organismic Principle</strong> (what a believer, follower, devotee, of OPBT is called) until
                they take it upon themselves to learn the fundamentals and then initiate themselves through
                their own ritual. An act of personally inspired dedication must proceed induction.</p>

              <p><span>SCOSH —</span> An acronym for: Sustainable, Compassionate, Organic, Socially Responsible and
                Healthy. Scosh is
                the Biotheistic equivalent to a Kosher or Halal standard for diet and dietary guidelines which are
                espoused and endorsed within our community. While Scosh standards do not necessarily
                conform to certain ritual activities, or dogmatic restrictions and rules for dietary choices, they do
                adhere to a basic set of considerations which a Scion should adhere to out of their personal
                respect for themselves, the greater biosphere, and all the organisms which contribute to their
                nutrition and health.<br>
                The Scosh standard is implemented though a scale of higher and lower Scosh color-coded
                grading, from Green to Red, with Green being 100% Scosh, and Red being !00% non-Scosh
                (the complete scale being Green/Blue/Yellow/Orange/Red). Scosh standards do encourage
                certain life-style choices over others, but leave the final implementation up to each person to
                suit their particular preferences and circumstances. Vegetarianism is encouraged, but not
                obligatory, as responsible and compassionate rearing and harvesting of animal food sources is
                not only possible, it is in certain cases ideal for many people, and —perhaps
                counter-intuitively — for the animals themselves. Because of the very complex nature of this
                issue, a full explanation of all considerations of the Scosh standard cannot be detailed in this
                glossary.<br>
                SCOSH and Veganism/Vegetarianism:<br>
                OPBT does not seek to dictate what is best to nourish the body of each individual, and so does
                not require the Scion to be vegan or vegetarian. What is required is that we have RESPECT for
                the food — plant or animal — that we deprive of life and take into our bodies to maintain our
                own lives.<br>
                What the Scion must be cognizant of is the organismic burden his/her eating habits is inflicting
                upon the biosphere. So long as one is dedicated to lessening this burden, the eating of meat
                and animal products is accepted and in some cases may even be highly applauded. For it can
                be observed that many species flourish and have co-evolved, living with humans providing
                many mutual benefits. Where a problem exists, is not in showing the highest respect to that
                which one kills or takes advantage of — and respect means caring for its wellbeing, health and
                comfort while it lives its life for your (sometimes exclusive) benefit. That being said, there are
                many reasons why a plant-centered diet is healthier for the body and for the planet. For one of
                the most obvious reasons being that it helps reduce suffering in the world.</p>

              <p><span>Strip-malling —</span> A broad term that describes what more technically could be understood as
                the secularized, homogenized and commercialized landscape of our cities, towns, social and
                mental infrastructure. Corporate commodification, with the main emphasis on profitability and
                utilitarian efficiency masked by faux cordiality and assimilated but denatured source culture.
                (intended to echo both ‘strip-mining’, and ‘mauling’).</p>

              <p><span>Subnatural —</span> adj. (incomplete)</p>

              <p><span>Super-Subjectivism —</span> Within Organismic Philosophy, subjectivism is accepted as the
                inescapable default of human awareness, whereas objectivism is understood as an abstract
                projection of the subjective, which seeks to (falsely) place the subject one step above or outside
                their own awareness. Of course this feat is not possible.<br>
                Ergo, a <em>Super-Subjectivist</em> is one who believes in objectivism, but realizes there can be no such
                thing.</p>

              <p><span>Superliminal —</span> Subliminal refers to stimuli below the consciousness, while supraliminal
                represents stimuli above the threshold of consciousness; i.e. things too big to see, too obvious
                to point out, the elephants in the room.</p>

              <p id="letter_23"><span>Word/Thought Pollution —</span> Just as the biosphere is able to be effected and contaminated by toxic chemicals and byproducts, the mindsphere.</p>

              <p><span>(The) Worm Mind —</span> The core organic mind inherited from our most ancient living ancestors.
                ToKnow ourselves truly as 'humans', we should keep in mind that our 'humanity' is but a sliver
                of our evolutionary heritage, if taken in full since the beginnings of our biological development.
                Therefore, before we can fully understand the human mind, we must come to better understand
                the Primate Mind, (and before that,) the Mammalian Mind (and before that,) the Reptilian Mind
                ... the Amphibian Mind ... the Fish Mind ... the Worm Mind ... the Cellular Mind ... the
                Molecular Mind... the Atomic Mind ... the Quantum Mind ... The Universal Mind</p>
