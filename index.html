            <blockquote>
              Life is sacred, that is to say, it is the supreme value, to which all other values are subordinate.
              <footer>&#8212; <cite>Albert Einstein</cite></footer>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Biotheism is not a new religion. Rather, it represents an ancient truth and worldview which has woven itself through the history of all peoples, religions and ideologies.</p>

            <p>Through ever growing vines of interconnectedness, and bursting into blossoms of truth and nourishing fruits of meaning in all corners of the world, the values of Biotheism can already be found throughout all our mythic human narratives
              in the symbolic form of animals, plants, fungi, and all the living beings who inhabit our inner or outer worlds, and which humans have reverently held within our collective consciousness.</p>

            <p>Biotheism seeks to unite all that can be called noble, all that can be seen as vital under one inclusive heading. For what can be more noble, inclusive or vital than for Life to Revere Life Itself?</p>

            <p>What can be more valid than to say it has always been our biological condition which unites us in purpose, and in moral fiber with all that surrounds us? To see life — *thriving life* — as the highest value, and health as the primal
              impetus behind all our moral systems, is only to give due deference to that which is both scientifically and spiritually valid…</p>

            <p>Biotheists dedicate themselves to stewardship and action, not a set of rigid beliefs or strict rules of conduct. Care for each other and the Earth are the true measures of a good Biotheist. We celebrate the key birthdates and life
              achievements of our scientific, spiritual, and artistic luminaries, but also the natural rhythms of the seasons and celestial convergences. Teachers, artists and healers hold our highest ecclesiastic offices.</p>

            <p>Perhaps most importantly, Biotheists seek to leave a light footprint, and to do so, adhere to deep ecological, and biocentric ethics, promoting Deep Ecology, Organic Permaculture, and green solutions to enduring problems. Through this
              platform we will seek to engage the wider public, promoting sensible and compassion based ethical guidelines such as the "SCOSH" dietary standard… an acronym for "Sustainable, Compassionate, Organic, Socially-responsible, and Healthy."
            </p>

            <p>At the center of understanding the Biotheist worldview, is understanding Organicism, or the view that the ultimate nature of reality is as a living organism. This is a systems-theory based view, wholly consistent with current theories
              at the forefront of science.</p>

            <p>Biotheism seeks to bridge the divide between theological philosophy, and philosophical theology — at its core embracing both reason and intuition; the sciences, as well as the arts and spiritual wisdom found throughout all cultures. As
              its full name implies, ‘Biosophy & Organismic Philosophy’ is founded upon the balance of both sides of the human condition; the ancient wisdom of our ancestors AND the value of modern empirical methodology. Another name for this
              worldview is ‘The Great Unteaching’; a response to the sad fact that humans have, for far too long, been conditioned to see these two perspectives as opposing one another, and inherently contradictory. We have been incorrectly led to
              believe that theology and science must be at odds, but nothing is further from the truth. They are only at odds when there is a lack of capacity for one perspective to understand and appreciate the other. Integrating both into one
              cohesive whole is central to the purposes of the Unteaching of Biotheism & Organismic Philosophy.</p>

            <p>Biotheism & Organismic Philosophy does not intend to miraculously or mysteriously alter one's basic understanding of themselves or reality. For it to be effective, it must be applicable at all levels of functionality, from the mundane
              activities that encompass our daily lives, to our highest and most mystical states. It should also not be seen as a radical replacement for our current beliefs (although this theoretically could occur), instead Biotheism serves as a
              clarification, and major alteration in our foundational emphasis — a cipher to help us better understand our humanity and spirituality in the context of our biological condition. Ultimately, it should be emphasized that Biotheism &
              Organismic Philosophy should not in any way be presented as a purely novel, or unfamiliar belief system. It is an affirmation and response to our most basic needs as living, feeling, caring beings. </p>

              All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. All these aspirations are directed toward ennobling human life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual towards freedom.

            <blockquote>
              My religion is nature. That’s what arouses those feelings of wonder and mysticism and gratitude in me.

            <blockquote>
